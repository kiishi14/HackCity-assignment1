PSEUDOCODE TO REVERSE THE ORDER OF CHARACTER IN A GIVEN STRINGS
Step 1:Start,
Step 2: Declare str and revStr,
Step 3: Let str = input, revStr = "",
Step 4: Read the input,
Step 5: Calculate the length of the string,
Step 6: initialize i = length-1
Step 7: Repeat until i>=0,
    - revStr += character at position "i" of the string
    - i -= 1
Step 8: Print revStr
step 9: Stop
